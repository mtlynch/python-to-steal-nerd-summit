### Why an info product?

* Want a way to earn money from my blog
* Book? Live course? Video course?

---

## Video courses sound easy!

* Daniel Vassallo made his course [in 16 hours](https://t.co/3evuHgEzIk?amp=1)
  * Earned $150k in under a year

---

### Video courses are hard

* I fuss a lot over slides and recording
* I've spent 50-60 hours so far and will likely spend at least 40 hours more

### Unexpected Challenges

1. Recording software (a lot of it sucks, even paid tools)
1. Writing sales copy
1. Opportunities to record
1. Recording a mostly good 20+ minute speech
1. No native way to do early access on Gumroad
