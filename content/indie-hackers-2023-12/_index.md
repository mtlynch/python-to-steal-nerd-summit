---

## TinyPilot finances

TODO: Graph

- Sell about 200 devices/month
- $80-100k/mo in revenue
- $10-20k/mo in profit

---

## Why sell?

- I don't enjoy hardware
- I miss being able to write code
- Lots of moving pieces, so most of my time is management

---

## First, I read books

- *Built to Sell* by John Warrilow
  - Think about how you'd sell from day one
  - The company should run without your day-to-day involvement
- *The Art of Selling Your Startup* by John Warrilow
  - Helpful for understanding the process and terms.

---

## What I want

- New owner continues developing the product
- New owner keeps the existing team
  - Most of the team has been with TinyPilot for \~3 years

---

## Acquisition attempt #1

- Asked my hardware consulting vendor in 2021
  - They know my hardware well
  - They have hardware and software expertise
  - They have software consultants who are under-utilized
  - Went back and forth a few times and they ultimately passed

---

## Broker: FE International

- Mostly handle SaaS businesses
- Told me that they wouldn't work with me

---

## Broker: Quiet Light

- Does a lot of eCommerce
- Main sponsor of MicroConf
- Recommended by another founder who had done several acquisitions
- Met them at MicroConf in March 2023 and liked one of the brokers

---

## Quiet Light Agreeement

- 15% of first $500k
- 5% of second $500k
- 10% of inventory
- 90-day exclusivity

---

## Strategic acquistions

- Quiet Light cuts fee in half if I find the acquirer
- Asked several homelab / indie hardware companies
  - Most didn't respond or said no
  - One was interested

---

## Valuation

- SDE: Seller discretionary earnings
  - Basically: Profit + "addbacks"
  - Addbacks are things you didn't *really* have to spend money on
    - e.g., I spent $4k to go to MicroConf in 2023, but that was a discretionary expense

---

## Valuation

- Multiple * TTM SDE
  - TTM = Trailing twelve months
  - Multiple is generally 2.5 to 3.5 for eCommerce businesses
  - Higher-growth rate means higher multiple

---

## TinyPilot's valuation

- TTM SDE: 214,422
- Asking price: $600k
- Implied multiple: 2.80

---

## Seller financing

- At first: Sure, why not. I don't need cash up-front.
- After talking to others: Only the payment at closing is guaranteed.

---

## Reasons to avoid seller financing

- You effectively work for the buyer until the debt is paid.
- At indie valuations, the cost of suing to recover debt usually outweighs the debt

---

## Reasons to avoid seller financing


- If you finance, your interest rates should be much higher than a bank
  - Bank already has tools for collecting debt
    - You have no tools

---

## Quiet Light Process

1. I provide profit and loss statements for the last three years
1. I answer a super long questionnaire (about 4-8 hours of work to answer)
1. Quiet Light puts my information into a pretty spreadsheet and "packet"
1. Quiet Light does a 10-minute video interview with me
1. Quiet Light posts my listing on their website
1. Quiet Light sends my listing to their list of buyers

---

## Quiet Light Launch

- \~100 inquiries in the first week
  - Inquiry is just someone requests the packet based on the listing
  - This is low

---

## Quiet Light Launch

- Two serious inquiries
  - One wanted me to stay as co-founder
  - The other is interested in taking over, but only has $300k cash
    - Trying to raise the rest

---

## SBA Loans

- Small business administration guarantees loans for acquisitions
  - I *think* it's zero or very low money down

---

## SBA Loan Pre-Qualification

- Businesses can pre-qualify based on past two years of tax returns
- TinyPilot not profitable enough in 2021
- Should pre-qualify in 2024 based on 2022-2023 tax returns
