## TinyPilot background

- KVM over IP device
  - Customers are IT departments and home prosumers
- Started in 2020

---

## Why sell?

- I don't enjoy hardware
- I miss being able to write code
- Lots of moving pieces, so most of my time is management

---

## *Built to Sell* by John Warrilow

- Think about how you'd sell from day one
- The company should run without your day-to-day involvement

---

## *The Art of Selling Your Startup* by John Warrilow

- Helpful for understanding the process and terms.

## Valuation

- SDE: Seller discretionary earnings
  - Basically: Profit + "addbacks"
  - Addbacks are things you didn't *really* have to spend money on
    - e.g., I spent $4k to go to MicroConf in 2023, but that was a discretionary expense

## Valuation

- Multiple * TTM SDE
  - TTM = Trailing twelve months
  - Multiple is generally 2.5 to 3.5 for eCommerce businesses
  - Higher-growth rate means higher multiple

---

## TinyPilot's valuation

- TTM SDE: 214,422
- Asking price: $600k
- Implied multiple: 2.80

---

## Seller financing

- At first: Sure, why not. I don't need cash up-front.
- After talking to others: Only the payment at closing is guaranteed.

---

## Reasons to avoid seller financing

- You effectively work for the buyer until the debt is paid.
- At indie valuations, the cost of suing to recover debt usually outweighs the debt

---

## Reasons to avoid seller financing


- If you finance, your interest rates should be much higher than a bank
  - Bank already has tools for collecting debt
  - You don't

---

## Strategic acquisitions

- Asked my hardware consulting vendor
- Asked several homelab / indie hardware companies
  - Most didn't respond or said no
  - One was interested

---

## Broker: FE International

- Told me that they wouldn't work with me
