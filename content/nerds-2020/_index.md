# Brute forcing bank logins

* Brute force can crack most bank passwords.
  * Banks are responsible for stopping this.

### How do you manage financial accounts without a bank?

* Traditional payment processors rely on banks to verify your identity.

---

# Public/private keys

### The heart of cryptocurrency

* Private key
  * Only you know it.
  * Proves that you're you.
* Public key
  * The world knows it.
  * Confirms that messages using your private key are correct.

### Encryption/decryption with a public/private keypair

### Public/private key encryption is one way

### Transfering cryptocurrency with public/private keys

```

* In short: private keys are like passwords that the world can verify.

### Preventing brute force for cryptocurrency

* Banks rate limit attempts to guess every password
  * You can't prevent people from guessing every private key.
  * Private keys must be strong

---

# Private key strength

* 256-bit random value (almost every cryptocurrency)
  * 2<sup>256</sup> possible keys
  * 10<sup>77</sup> possible keys
* Atoms on Earth: 10<sup>50</sup>
* Atoms in the universe: 10<sup>82</sup>

# Sia

### A marketplace for disk storage

* Like Airbnb, but for disk space
* Participants pay one another in Siacoin

# Finding the mistake

* Transposed letters?
  * `meat` -> `meta`

---

# Finding the mistake

* Added or subtracted letters?
  * `heart` -> `heat`

---

# Finding the mistake

* Incorrect letter?
  * `tagged` -> `tugged`

---

# Where did those words come from

* How did Sia generate the passphrase?

---

# To the dictionary!

* Sia uses a library called [entropy-mnemonics](https://github.com/NebulousLabs/entropy-mnemonics)
* Its dictionary contains 1,626 words

```golang
  englishDictionary = Dictionary{
    "abbey",
    "abducts",
    "ability",
    "ablaze",
    "abnormal",
    "abort",
    "abrasive",
    "absorb",
    "abyss",
    "academy",
    "aces",
    "aching",
    "acidic",
    "acoustic",
    "acquire",
    "across",
    "actress",
    ...
```

# Ctrl+F my way to riches

* Which word is not in the dictionary?

# No dice

* Every word is in dictionary

---

# Finding similar words

* How do we find words that are one copying error away from one another?

---

# Levenshtein distance

* Measures "edit distance" between two words

| Word A  | Word B  | Distance  |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| ca**t** | ca**r** | 1         |
| ca**t** | **s**ca**r** | 2    |

# Transactions stuck in limbo

* Cryptocurrencies can process a limited number of transactions
  * Usually a few hundred per minute.
* When the network is overloaded, transactions get stuck in limbo.
  * Sender has sent the money, but the recipient hasn't received it.
