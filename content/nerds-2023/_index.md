## Why improve your code reviews?

Helps:

* Your reviewer
* Your team
* You

---

## Learn faster

If you prepare your changelist properly, it directs your reviewer's attention to areas that support your growth rather than boring style violations. When you demonstrate an appreciation for constructive criticism, your reviewer provides better feedback .

---

## Make others better

Your code review techniques set an example for your colleagues. Effective author practices rub off on your teammates, which makes your job easier when they send code to you.

---

## Minimize team conflicts

Code reviews are a common source of friction. Approaching them deliberately and conscientiously minimizes arguments.

---

## The golden rule

### Value your reviewer's time

---

### Review your own code first
