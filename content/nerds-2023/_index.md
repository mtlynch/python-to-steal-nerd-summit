## Improve code reviews as the author

### Review your own code first

---

### Review your own code first

* Put yourself in their mindset
    * Think of how you'd read the code without additional context
* Use a diff view

---

### Review your own code first

* Your reviewer should not be seeing
    * Debug code you forgot to delete
    * Extra files you accidentally included
    * Unresolved merged conflicts

---

## Write a clear changelist description

* Everything the reviewer needs should be in the code or the description

---

## Write a clear changelist description

* Explaing the context around the change
* The **why** not the **how**

---

## Automate the easy stuff

---

## Automate the easy stuff

* git pre-commit hooks
* Integrate linters/formatters
* Continuous integration (CI)

---

## Answer questions with the code itself

## Answer questions with the code itself

* If your reviewer has this question, others will likely have the same question

##### Separate functional and non-functional changes

- One-line change
  - Easy to review
- Whitespace-only change
  - Easy to review
- One-line functional change within 200 lines of whitespace changes
  - *Painful* to review
