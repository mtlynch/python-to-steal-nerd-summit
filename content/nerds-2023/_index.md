### Value your reviewer's time

* Easiest thing to do is a lazy review
* A quality review is a gift
* Reward them for putting in the time

---

### Review your own code first

---

### Review your own code first

* Put yourself in their mindset
    * Think of how you'd read the code without additional context
* Use a diff view

---

### Review your own code first

* Your reviewer should not be seeing
    * Debug code you forgot to delete
    * Extra files you accidentally included
    * Unresolved merged conflicts

---

## Write a clear changelist description

* Explaing the context around the change
* The **why** not the **how**

---

## Automate the easy stuff
