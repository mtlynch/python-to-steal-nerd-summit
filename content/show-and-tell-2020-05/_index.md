### Biggest bang for your buck:<br>Get an editor

* [Why a Freelance Editor Was a Gamechanger for My Blog](https://mtlynch.io/editor/)
* You've got lots of blind spots that a professional editor can identify.
* A good editor costs $75-150 to review 2,000 words.
* I still work with my editor about once a year for tune-ups.

# Picking topics:<br>start at distribution

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row;">

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; max-width: 40%; font-size: 14pt;">

>**Pet shop owner**: This little guy writes mysteries under the name JB MacGregor.<br>
>**Lisa**: How can a hamster write mysteries?<br>
>**Pet shop owner**: Well, he gets the ending first, then he works backwards.<br>
-*The Simpsons*

</div>

* How will people find my post?
  * Search
  * Reddit / Forums
  * Hacker News
  * Twitter

</div>

### This is why I can't blog about blogging

* There are forums and social networks for bloggers, but...
  * They don't accept external links
  * They don't want people popping in to promote their own post
* Difficult to rank for almost any search term related to blogging

---

### Posts about software / technology are easier to share

* Example: 
  * [GreenPiThumb: A Raspberry Pi Gardening Bot](https://mtlynch.io/greenpithumb/)
  * Suitable for:
    * [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14644539)
    * [/r/programming](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/6jujfi/greenpithumb_a_raspberry_pi_gardening_bot/)
    * [/r/raspberry_pi](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/6js62b/greenpithumb_a_raspberry_pi_gardening_bot/)
    * [/r/homeautomation](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/6jsalc/greenpithumb_a_raspberry_pi_gardening_bot/)
    * Raspberry Pi forums

### Traffic != success

I blog for a few different reasons

* Vanity
  * If I'm being honest
* Clarify my thinking
* Lead people to my products
  * [Resurrecting a Dead Library](https://mtlynch.io/resurrecting-1/), low traffic but leads people to [Zestful](https://zestfuldata.com)
* Improve SEO for my products by linking to them
* Establish credibility when talking to new people

### Commonalities of the hits

* Tell an engaging or fun story
* Teach something broadly useful
* Repackage existing ideas in a way people enjoy
* The topics match social media channels that accept external links

---

### Commonalities of flops

* Teach something overly specific
* No social media channel that will accept them
* Describe failure
  * Failure is hard to make fun and engaging unless it's spectacular

---

### My process

1. Rank ideas
1. First draft
1. Editing
1. Illustrations
1. Despair
1. Read aloud
1. Grammarly
1. Publish

---

### 1. Rank ideas

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row;">

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center">

* My ideas look like this
* When I get new ideas, I write a title and shortform notes
* I reorder the list based on what I'm most interested in writing
* Topics can spend years in my queue

</div>

<img src="post-ideas.png" style="margin-left: 20px; max-width: 38%">

</div>

---

### 1. Rank ideas

* How I evaluate article ideas:
  * Are there already good articles that cover the same topic?
  * Do I have something unique to contribute?
  * Is there an audience interested in the topic?
  * Do I have a viable a channel to reach that audience?

---

### 2. First draft

* Just get all my ideas onto the page
* Add headings if I can think of them, but don't worry about structure
* Just keep writing continuously and don't stop to look anything up
  * I put TODOs in places where I want to add a link, look something up, or add an image.

---

### 3. Editing

* Takes the longest time and is the most mentally taxing
* Good writing crystallizes ideas and explains them clearly and succinctly
  * This is really hard!

---

### What it looks like

---

### Why so much time editing?

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row;">

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center">

* Results are not linear with effort

</div>

# Other tips

---

### The hook: why should people read it?

* Establish in the first few sentences:
  * What is this post about?
  * What value will they gain by reading it?

>You have two or three sentences to hook them. A paragraph if you're lucky.<br>-My editor

---

### The hook: why should people read it?

* This is the most common mistake I see.
  * Bloggers assume people have infinite patience to read their post and find the value.

---

### Original artwork: way undervalued


<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row;">

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center; font-size: 14pt;">

* Anecdotal, but immediately makes your post stand out.
* Costs $20-60/image.
  * Depends on artist and level of detail.
* Make a cover image that's 1.91:1 aspect ratio
  * Displays nicely in Twitter, Facebook, and (sort of) Reddit

### How hard is it to broaden accessibility?

Small changes often make my posts accessible to a much broader audience.

>I stored the files on **S3**.

vs.

>I stored the files on **S3, Amazon's cloud storage service**.
